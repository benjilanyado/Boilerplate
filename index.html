						There are few places left in the world where you can get well and truly lost. But then there are few places in the world like Fez el Bali, an impenetrable maze of lanes and blind alleys that make up the beating heart of Morocco’s cultural capital. <br/>Resist the urge to pull a map from your pocket and go with the human flow. Drop down into the bowels of the Medina, past camel heads advertising the local butchers and vendors bartering in the spice souk. <br/>Let your senses steer you: to the sound of metalworkers hammering away at immense copper cauldrons on Place Seffarine; to the brightly coloured yarns drying in the heat on Souk Sabbaghine; or to the thick stench of the tanneries, a medieval scene of workers stood knee deep in a honeycomb of vats, soaking hides in pigeon dung and dyes of red, yellow, blue and green.

						While Reykjavik, with its bright primary-coloured corrugated metal houses and welcoming residents, is an essential base - and the Blue Lagoon is a justifiably popular attraction - to really experience Iceland you need to find a glacier. A short minibus ride from the capital will take you far from the tourist trail of lava fields and waterfalls and into endless icy oblivion. Here, armed with crampons and pickaxes, you can explore the endless crevices and precarious ridges of the country’s vast but receding glaciers. The locals spend a week trekking over some of the larger masses and camping overnight on bare ice, but an afternoon is plenty.

						I’d recommend a journey to what I called the Teatime Islands in my first travel book of the same name. They’re incredibly remote islands that still belong to the UK and encompass the Pitcairn Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean, Carcass Island which is part of the Falkland Islands, and St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. The one I’d really highlight would be Tristan de Cunha in the Atlantic Ocean. Spending two weeks on a ship from Cape Town is a fantastically romantic way to arrive.

						It’s hard to miss Mount Vesuvius, the conical mound looming over the countryside east of Naples. Even though the last eruption occurred over sixty years ago, I still felt rather daring – and nervous – scaling the summit (a mildly strenuous 30min walk from ticket booths near the top) of this infamous killer. In AD 79 a deadly concoction of lava, ash and poisonous gas engulfed the two Roman towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. I’d definitely recommend a visit to Herculaneum– the smaller and more manageable of the sites – after the climb, which brings both context and an unsettling dollop of poignancy.

						I’ll never forget stumbling wobbly-legged out of a rickety cable car to see this ancient monolith snaking away across the hills. It's one of China’s few "must-see" sights that really lives up to expectations. To make sure you see the original fortifications, bypass the super-touristy reconstruction at Badaling and head on to more remote Jinshanling. Just don’t attempt the steep-sided scramble in flip-flops as I did; this stunning stretch is mostly un-restored and the hike is as challenging as it as is scenic in places.

Legend has it that if you spend a night at the top you will die, become a poet or go mad, but the views from here are stunning – a patchwork of greens interrupted by molten-metal slivers of river estuary and sea. Hardy visitors can have a dip in Cwm Cau too, which changes colour from lagoon blue to inky black as clouds race overheard.

						 You won’t forget the first time you see an iceberg. I assumed it was a small island or a cruise ship, towering over lobster boats like a floating white cathedral. Once I got closer the air changed, got colder; I could actually sense the density of ice looming ahead. Up close it was a sort of bluish, translucent white, whittled by the wind and salt into strange, Dali-esque shapes and curves. Finally, when the boat cut its engine, hissing, popping and cracking sounds drifted eerily across the waves – the iceberg was alive, growling across the Atlantic.

						The Galápagos islands are among the most remote and magical destinations on earth, so the sight of vast modern cruise ships chugging between them can come as a shock. To visit the islands in style pick a smaller vessel, preferably one with sails as well as an engine. With the sound of canvas flapping in the wind and the creak of wooden decks beneath your feet, you can almost imagine how a certain young Mr Darwin felt when he arrived here in 1835.

						One thing that still lingers in my memory is swimming with manatees in Crystal River in Florida. You go out at dawn and lower yourself into a misty river, then suddenly these manatees the size of a car nuzzle up next to you and take an interest – and in my case they gave me a hug and rolled around with me. It’s one of the best interactions I’ve had with the natural world, and while it’s a touristy thing it doesn’t feel that way when you’re doing it.

						Nicaragua’s former capital and the birthplace of the Sandinista revolution, vibrant León offers lovely colonial architecture, fun museums and superlative fried chicken.  You can also take an unusual tour to the steep ash of nearby Cerro Negro, where gas belches from cracks and views stretch over Nicaragua’s Pacific plains. The walk up is a slog, while the descent sees you surf down the dune-like surface as dust rises around you. You can sit or stand – you’ll almost certainly fall – and while it’s rare to get up much of a top speed, the experience is thrillingly surreal.

Sure, the boats are rickety and old, the seats are uncomfortable, and these days its hard to predict if they’ll actually be running, but the three day journey, from sublime Luang Prabang to the tiny, isolated settlement of Hat Sa, gives you that rare feeling of experiencing a part of the country that few foreigners see.

						Every morning a procession of dusty elephants is led to the Rapti River, on the edge of Chitwan National Park, for a good scrub down – and travellers are welcome to help out. The pachyderms delight in shooting jets of water from their trunks, wallowing on their sides while layers of mud are scraped off and, occasionally, dumping unsuspecting riders into the river. It’s a magical experience that the elephants seem to enjoy almost as much as the travellers.

						Viñales, a sleepy little town to the west of Havana, is in many ways typical of rural Cuba. What sets it apart, however, are the mogotes (boulder-like hillocks) that jut out of the landscape and provide a magnificent backdrop to an already picturesque part of the country. It’s lovely just lolling around in the sunshine taking in the strange and beautiful vistas, but to ramp the experience up a notch, hire a scooter and wind your way around the mogotes along the local road to the coast. Once at the beach at Cayo Jutías it's more of the same idyllic sands and impossibly blue Caribbean water. The real joy is of course the journey: empty open roads, wind in your hair and spectacular rock formations as far as the eye can see.

I do know that the Caribbean Sea never felt so refreshing as afterwards, and my skin never looked so good.

						The one place I wish everyone could visit is Tibet. It's sad in many places now, hideously over-developed and not at all the place you imagine. But it remains the one place I know that exerts a curious kind of spell and takes you to a different part of your being, for better or for worse. And in some ways its spirit has been strengthened and intensified even as - or sometimes because - its surfaces have been destroyed. Ladakh is more beautiful, Bhutan is better protected, Nepal is more funky. But Tibet is one place from which it's hard to come home unaltered, and in ways you can never predict.

						The Chapada Diamantina (Diamond Highlands) are Brazil’s top trekking destination. Hikers find that, upon a hilltop, not only does the landscape change, but so does the ecosystem. These highlands lie in the interior of Bahia where three of Brazil’s biomes meet: the Atlantic rainforest, the cerrado – similar to the African savannah – and the caatinga (shrubland), which feels like the American chaparral. You can explore dry caves, swim in underground lakes, dive under waterfalls and climb near-vertical mesas all in the same day. The only constant in the scenery is unwavering change.

There’s even a constitutional law protecting everyone’s right to enjoy the great outdoors. So go swimming, drink from a stream, or fill your belly with red berries. Then sip whisky around the campfire and crash out on a reindeer skin, gazing up at the starry sky.

						As the sun shifts, the Sahara Desert takes on different colours: silvery white at dawn; ochre in the heat of the day; deep gold at sunset. We stayed at a Berber camp and fell asleep on our backs, counting shooting stars that burned through the darkness like rogue coals from the campfire. At 6am we climbed a sand dune overlooking Algeria and watched the sun emerge from the horizon, a blazing ball of desert red that turned the sand rose gold. Desolate, but beautiful.

						In the vast, swampy grasslands of Pampas del Yacuma, the pink freshwater dolphin is one of the more pleasant surprises hidden in the murky waters of the Bolivian Amazon. With the annual floods, bubblegum pink dolphins dreamily glide amidst tree trunks and chase fish between drowned, twisted branches. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of diving into these muddy, unknown depths to swim alongside these surreal creatures; it’s a far cry from the pristine pleasure of frolicking with dolphins in SeaWorld.

						For a real once-in-a-lifetime experience, give reclusive North Korea a try. There's little point in going twice, since the obligatory guided tours cover almost everything that you're actually allowed to see. Most travellers, however, find their trip worth every single penny, since there's simply nothing similar anywhere else on earth. A near-carless treasure trove of Brutalist architecture, the capital city of Pyongyang is particularly photogenic; others focus on a people who bear terrible repression with surprising grace.

						A visit to the historical site of Tikal in Guatemala should be on everyone’s bucket list. These ancient Mayan ruins are a testament to a civilization long passed. If you stay overnight, you can be there without the crowds giving the place an empty, eerie feeling that really makes you feel like you are Indiana Jones. It’s not often you get major historical sites to yourself but I found that it was just me, Tikal, and the jungle.
